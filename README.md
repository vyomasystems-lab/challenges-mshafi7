# MUX Design Verification(Level1Design1)

## Test Scenario **(Important)**
- Test Inputs: all inputs are set to 1
- Expected Output: for sel value from 0 to 30 expected output is 1
- Observed Output in the DUT dut.out = 0 at 13 ns and also at 30n2

Output mismatches for the above inputs proving that there is a design bug

## Design Bug
Based on the above test input and analysing the design, we see the following

```
      5'b01011: out = inp11;
      5'b01101: out = inp12;    <== Bug "two cases with 01101"
      5'b01101: out = inp13;
      5'b01110: out = inp14;
```
```
      5'b11101: out = inp29;    <== inp30 is not assigned
      default: out = 0;
    endcase
```

So assigning ``5'b11110: out = inp30;`` and ``5'b01100: out = inp12;`` in the design code will fix the bug.

## Design Fix
Updating the design and re-running the test makes the test pass.

The updated design is checked in as adder_fix.v

## Verification Strategy
Assigning a constant value to all the input except select line and creating a loop in which select line value is varied and output is observed. If output doesn't match the input value commonly assigned then there is a bug. For every loop there is 1ns Delay so we can find the bug based on failure time.
## Is the verification complete ?
*Yes the Verification is Complete

# Sequence Detector(Level1Design2)

## Test Scenario **(Important)**
- Test Inputs: 111011 and 1011011 (overlaping Sequence)
- Expected Output: Machine should detect sequence for overlapping sequence
- Observed Output in the DUT dut.out = Sequence not detected for overlapping sequence 

Output mismatches for the above inputs proving that there is a design bug

## Design Bug
Based on the above test input and analysing the design, we see the following

```
      SEQ_1:
      begin
        if(inp_bit == 1)
          next_state = IDLE;    <== Bug
        else
```
```
      SEQ_101:
      begin
        if(inp_bit == 1)
          next_state = SEQ_1011;
        else
          next_state = IDLE;     <== BUG
```
```
    SEQ_1011:
        next_state = IDLE;    <== BUG
```

So assigning ``next_state = SEQ_1;`` in else of SEQ_1 state, assigning ``next_state = SEQ_10;`` in else of SEQ_101 state and putting if condition ``if(inp_bit == 1)
        next_state = SEQ_1;
      else
        next_state = SEQ_10;
      end`` in SEQ_1011 state fixed the bug.

## Design Fix
Updating the design and re-running the test makes the test pass.
